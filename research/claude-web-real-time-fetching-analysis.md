# Claude-Web: Real-time Content Fetching and Schema Processing

## Executive Summary

Claude-Web is Anthropic's real-time content fetching bot that activates during live conversations when current information is needed. Unlike training data collection, Claude-Web operates **during user interactions**, potentially allowing for structured data processing before tokenization occurs.

**Key Finding**: Schema markup may be most valuable specifically for Claude-Web interactions, not for training data collection.

## What Claude-Web Actually Is

### Official Anthropic Bot Infrastructure

Anthropic operates three distinct web crawling bots for different purposes:

1. **ClaudeBot** - Main crawler for model training that "visits public websites to collect data that improves Claude's long-term knowledge"
2. **Claude-Web** - Real-time fetcher that "appears when a user query prompts Claude to retrieve real-time information" and "fetches content on demand to answer specific prompts"
3. **anthropic-ai** - Additional training data crawler with "unconfirmed purpose"

### User Agent Identification

**Claude-Web Bot String:**
```
Claude-Web/1.0 (web crawler; +https://www.anthropic.com/; bots@anthropic.com)
```

Currently, Claude-Web is listed as an "AI-related agent operated by Anthropic" but "it's currently unclear exactly what it's used for, since there's no official documentation."

## How Claude-Web Operates: Real-time Fetching

### The Live Query Process

```
User Query → Claude Internal Decision → Claude-Web Activation → Content Fetch → Processing → Response
```

**Example Scenario:**
1. User asks: "What's Kalyani Khona working on in 2025?"
2. Claude determines it needs current information
3. **Claude-Web fetches** relevant web pages in real-time
4. Content is processed and analyzed
5. Claude provides response with live citations

### Key Operational Differences

| Bot Type | Purpose | Timing | Schema Opportunity |
|----------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| **ClaudeBot** | Training data collection | Pre-training phase | No - Lost in tokenization |
| **Claude-Web** | Real-time content fetching | During live conversation | Yes - Potential parsing before tokenization |

---

## The Schema Processing Hypothesis

### Where Schema Could Be Valuable

**Critical Timing**: Claude-Web fetches content **during active conversations**, not for training data collection.

**Potential Processing Pipeline:**
```
Claude-Web Fetch → Schema Parsing → Content Understanding → Tokenization → Response Generation
```

### Why This Matters for Schema Investment

**Training Data Collection (ClaudeBot)**:
- Content collected months/years ago
- Schema destroyed during tokenization
- Minimal benefit for current queries

**Real-time Fetching (Claude-Web)**:
- Content fetched during live conversation
- **Opportunity for schema parsing before tokenization**
- Enhanced content understanding for immediate response

---

## Technical Implementation: Known vs Unknown

### What We Know

**Confirmed Facts:**
- Claude-Web "fetches content on demand to answer specific prompts"
- It operates when "a user query prompts Claude to retrieve real-time information"
- Anthropic bots "respect robots.txt directives" and follow "standard web crawler protocols"
- Claude's crawlers "do not execute JavaScript"

**Blocking/Control:**
```
# robots.txt - To block Claude-Web
User-agent: Claude-Web
Disallow: /
```

### What We Don't Know

**Technical Unknowns:**
- **Schema parsing pipeline**: Whether Claude-Web specifically processes structured data before tokenization
- **Content prioritization**: How schema markup affects content understanding
- **Processing sequence**: Exact order of parsing vs tokenization
- **Structured data handling**: Whether schema gets special treatment during real-time fetching

### Speculation vs Facts: A Clarification

**My Previous Claim:**
> "Direct Crawling (GPTBot, Claude-Web) - Can parse structured data before tokenization"

**Reality Check:**
- **Claude-Web exists** and does real-time fetching
- **Schema parsing capabilities** are unconfirmed - this was speculation
- **Timing advantage** exists (real-time vs training data)
- **Technical implementation** details are not publicly documented

## Strategic Implications for Schema Investment

### The Claude-Web Advantage

**Why Claude-Web Matters More for Schema:**

1. **Real-time Processing**: Content fetched during live conversations
2. **Fresh Content Priority**: Focuses on current, up-to-date information  
3. **Query-Specific**: Targeted fetching based on user needs
4. **Pre-tokenization Opportunity**: Potential for structured data processing

### Schema ROI for Claude-Web Scenarios

**High-Value Schema Applications:**
```json
{
  "@type": "Person",
  "name": "Kalyani Khona",
  "jobTitle": "Angel Investor",
  "dateModified": "2025-08-19",
  "worksFor": {
    "@type": "Organization", 
    "name": "GEO VC"
  }
}
```

**Benefits for Real-time Fetching:**
- **Entity Recognition**: Clear identification of person/organization

## Monitoring Claude-Web Activity

### Detection in Server Logs

**User Agent String to Monitor:**
```
Claude-Web/1.0 (web crawler; +https://www.anthropic.com/; bots@anthropic.com)
```

**Log Analysis Questions:**
1. **Frequency**: How often does Claude-Web visit vs ClaudeBot?
2. **Timing**: When do real-time fetches occur?
3. **Content Patterns**: Which pages get fetched during live queries?
4. **Correlation**: Do schema-rich pages get cited more often?

### Robots.txt Considerations

## Multi-Agentic Workflow: Claude's Research Orchestration

### The Internal Planning Process

When Claude receives a query like **"What's Kalyani Khona's latest project?"**, it doesn't simply trigger Claude-Web directly. Instead, it executes a sophisticated multi-agent research workflow:

### Captured Workflow Breakdown

**1. Research Plan Creation**
```
Query Analysis → Concept Breakdown → Entity Identification → Temporal Constraints → Answer Format Planning
```

**Example Planning Output:**
> "Main concepts: Kalyani Khona, latest project, recent work, current projects, recent announcements"
> "Key entities: Kalyani Khona (the person), her projects/work" 
> "Temporal constraints: Focus on 'latest', 'most recent', 'current'"

**2. Query Type Determination**
```
Classification: "Straightforward query" 
Strategy: "Fact-finding about one person's current activities"
Complexity Assessment: "Doesn't require multiple perspectives"
```

**3. Agent Deployment Strategy**
```
Decision: "Deploy 1 comprehensive subagent to handle the research"
Coordination: "Initial searching to guide the process"
Execution: "Leverage web search capabilities through multiple online sources"
```

### Multi-Agent Coordination Architecture

**Planning Agent**: 
- Analyzes query complexity and requirements
- Determines research strategy and agent deployment
- Creates detailed execution plan

**Search Coordination Agent**:
- Determines optimal search strategy
- Coordinates between different data sources
- Manages information gathering sequence

**Claude-Web Agent** (Our Focus):
- Executes real-time content fetching
- **Potentially processes schema during content retrieval**
- Provides structured data to synthesis agents

**Analysis Agent**:
- Processes retrieved content
- Extracts relevant information
- Validates source credibility

**Synthesis Agent**:
- Combines information from multiple sources
- Creates coherent narrative
- Generates final response

### Schema Processing Implications

**Multi-Agent Schema Advantages:**

1. **Specialized Processing**: Each agent could handle schema differently
   - **Claude-Web**: Raw schema parsing during fetch
   - **Analysis Agent**: Schema-enhanced content understanding  
   - **Synthesis Agent**: Schema-informed content prioritization

2. **Content Validation**: Multiple agents can cross-reference schema markup
   - **Entity validation** across different sources
   - **Freshness verification** using schema timestamps
   - **Relationship mapping** between schema entities

3. **Enhanced Decision Making**: Schema helps agents coordinate
   - **Planning Agent** uses schema to understand content types
   - **Search Agent** prioritizes schema-rich sources
   - **Analysis Agent** leverages schema for content categorization

### The Workflow in Action

**Query**: "What's Kalyani Khona's latest project?"

```
Planning Agent:
├── Identifies need for current information
├── Recognizes entity (Kalyani Khona)
└── Plans comprehensive research approach

└── Provides attributed response
```

### Why This Matters for Schema Strategy

**Enhanced Schema Value in Multi-Agent Systems:**

1. **Multiple Processing Opportunities**: Schema gets processed by different specialized agents
2. **Cross-Agent Validation**: Schema markup helps agents verify information consistency
3. **Improved Coordination**: Structured data facilitates better agent communication
4. **Content Prioritization**: Schema signals help agents identify most relevant sources

**Strategic Implication**: Schema markup doesn't just help one bot (Claude-Web) - it potentially enhances the entire multi-agent research workflow.
