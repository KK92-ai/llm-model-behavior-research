# GEO Insights with [Neuverge Labs Private Limited](https://neusearch.ai/) - Meeting #2
*Research Notes by Kalyani Khona | July 15, 2025*

## Technical Challenges 

- AI models exhibit high variability in responses due to temperature 
- Consistency requires multiple query runs and aggregation of results
- Different prompt phrasings yield different results even for identical intent
- Same prompts yield different results too (temperature, memory)
- Web search triggering in AI models is inconsistent and difficult to predict

### Accuracy and Measurement
"Accuracy" in GEO context refers to:
  - Consistency of brand mentions across multiple runs
  - Factual correctness of brand information presented
  - Confidence level that a brand will appear for specific queries
  
### Basic Infra Related Notes
- Serverless architecture recommended for scalability
- Need for robust database schema to handle large query volumes
- Multiple-run aggregation system essential for reducing result variability
- Fallback systems required for API failures

## Product Development Roadmap

### Essential Features for GEO Platform
1. **Brand Visibility Tracking**
   - Citation landscape analysis
   - Competitor comparison metrics
   - Trend indicators over time

2. **Content Optimization Engine**
   - Analysis of which content formats perform best
   - Probability indicators for content being cited
   - Multi-agent architecture for content analysis

3. **Query Analysis**
   - Differentiation between web-search and non-web-search prompts
   - Intent mapping for different query types
   - Pattern recognition for high-value queries

### Pricing Strategy Discussion
- Feature-based pricing more understandable than prompt-based pricing
- Free tier should be demo-like to establish value
- Eventually tiered model with clear feature differentiation

## GTM Notes (Opening Thoughts)

### Potential Routes
- Direct partnerships with brands preferred over agency partnerships
- Pilot programs with established brands to build track record
- Content creation and distribution for brand awareness
- Case studies with permission rights essential for organic growth
- Community building among marketers for organic growth

### Positioning Recommendations
- Avoid "SEO 2.0" messaging
- Focus on brand (marketing) visibility rather than sales metrics
- Emphasize unique capabilities for AI optimization
- Platform approach (showing we can present execution and solution) resonates better with me than single-feature tracking tools. Team is aligned on this.

## Technical Implementation Best Practices

### Development Priorities
1. Backend prompting module for query execution
2. Dashboard for visibility and analytics
3. Integration capabilities with existing marketing tools
4. Automated workflow systems to reduce manual processes

### Cost Optimization
**section retracted private notes**

## Future Roadmap 

### Customization and Third Party Integrations
- Third-party integrations with SEO tools
- Automated optimization recommendations
- Cross-platform AI visibility tracking
- Industry-specific optimization playbooks

### Scalability Planning
- Platform/ecosystem approach allows for feature expansion
- Build for multiple AI models, not just one platform (but could start with ChatGPT)
- Consider international market differences in AI usage

## Pending Discussion on tracking KPI

- **Mention Rate**: Percentage of times brand appears in AI responses
- **Position Score**: Average position of brand in AI-generated lists
- **Consistency Score**: Variation in results across multiple runs
- **Optimization Impact**: Measurable improvement after content changes
- **Time to Results**: Speed of achieving visibility improvements
