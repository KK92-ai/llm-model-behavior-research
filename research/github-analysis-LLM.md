#### Real-time Search Crawling  
- **Additional Crawlers**: 
  - ChatGPT-User (for user-directed content fetching)
  - OAI-SearchBot (for search functionality)
- **Behavior**: Fetches content in response to specific user queries, not for bulk training

#### GitHub Usage Patterns
- **Training Data Sources**: Known to use CommonCrawl datasets that include GitHub content
- **Content Types**: Code repositories, documentation, README files, issue discussions
- **Filtering**: Excludes paywalled content and attempts to remove personally identifiable information

### 1.2 Anthropic (Claude)

#### Training Phase Crawling
- **Primary Crawlers**: 
  - ClaudeBot (current primary crawler)
  - Legacy crawlers: ANTHROPIC-AI, CLAUDE-WEB (being phased out)
- **Controversy**: Faced significant criticism in 2024 for aggressive crawling behavior
- **Legal Issues**: Reddit lawsuit in 2024 alleging over 100,000 unauthorized accesses despite being blocked

#### Real-time Search Crawling
- **Web Search Integration**: Launched web search capabilities in 2024
- **API Integration**: Provides web search through Anthropic API with citation requirements
- **Domain Controls**: Offers allow/block lists for enterprise customers

#### GitHub Usage Patterns

- **Training Datasets**: Incorporates GitHub content through various pathways including CommonCrawl

### 1.4 Perplexity

#### Training Phase Crawling
- **Primary Crawler**: PerplexityBot
- **Major Controversy**: Accused by Cloudflare in August 2024 of using stealth crawlers to bypass blocks
- **Stealth Tactics**: Reported to disguise crawling identity when blocked, using generic browser user agents

#### Real-time Search Crawling
- **User Agent**: Perplexity-User (for real-time queries)
- **Volume**: Processes 20-25 million daily requests according to Cloudflare data
- **RAG Focus**: Emphasis on Retrieval Augmented Generation rather than bulk training

#### GitHub Usage Patterns
- **Evasion Techniques**: Allegedly modifies user agents and source ASNs to hide crawling activity
- **Content Targeting**: Focuses on current, up-to-date information for answer generation
- **Compliance Issues**: Multiple reports of ignoring robots.txt directives
