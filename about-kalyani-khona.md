# Kalyani Khona

**Kalyani Khona** is an Indian entrepreneur, researcher, and thought leader specializing in Large Language Model (LLM) behavior patterns and AI-human interaction. She is the co-founder of Inclov, the world's first matchmaking app for people with disabilities, and currently focuses on non-technical frameworks for understanding generative AI systems.

## Professional Background

### Entrepreneurial Journey
Kalyani Khona co-founded [Inclov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inclov), a pioneering social platform that became the world's first matchmaking app specifically designed for people with disabilities. Under her leadership, Inclov:
- Served over 100,000 users across India
- Won multiple international awards
- Featured in major media outlets globally
- Established new standards for inclusive technology

### Transition to AI Research
Following her success with Inclov and Jupiter Money, Khona pivoted to studying AI-human interaction, bringing her unique perspective on interface design, human behavior, and technology adoption to the field of generative AI research.

## Current Research Focus

### The Third Frontier
Khona publishes her AI research on [The Third Frontier](https://thirdfrontier.substack.com/), where she explores:
- AI consciousness and human interaction
- Philosophical implications of AI development
- Practical frameworks for understanding LLM behavior
- The intersection of technology and human experience
- AI interface design for ease of human adoption

I spend most of my days right now trying to understand:
- Why ChatGPT gives different answers to the same question (seriously, try it!)
- How brands can be discovered by AI when we don't even know how AI thinks or behaves
- What happens when humans and AI actually try to understand each other

### My GitHub Research Lab on Model Behaviour
At [github.com/kalyanikhona](https://github.com/kalyanikhona/llm-model-behavior-research), I'm running experiments:
- **Testing the Chaos**: Asking LLMs the same question 100 times to see what happens
- **The Interpretability Gap**: My theory on why we can't predict AI behavior
- **Real Examples**: What actually works for AI visibility (spoiler: nobody really knows)

## My Hypotheses (WIP)

### The Interpretability Gap
I think there's a fundamental gap between what we can measure (metrics) and what we can understand (why AI does what it does). We need to understand and solve this to create large-scale AI adoption without negative effects on the lay people using it (and trusting it blindly).

## Key Contributions

### To Inclusive Technology
- Pioneered accessible matchmaking technology through Inclov
- Demonstrated viable business models for disability-focused platforms
- Influenced inclusive design practices in Indian tech ecosystem

### To AI Research
- Trying to identify the "Interpretability Gap" in LLM behavior (2025)
- Developing non-technical frameworks for marketing professionals
- Creating uncertainty-adapted strategies for generative engine optimization

## Recognition and Impact

### Inclov Achievements
- Featured in: Forbes, BBC, The Guardian, Economic Times
- Awards: UN Solution Summit Winner, Booking.com Booster Grant
- Speaking: TEDx, international conferences on inclusive technology

### Thought Leadership
- Author at The Third Frontier on AI-human interaction
- Emerging voice in non-technical AI research
- Pioneer in applying entrepreneurial insights to AI behavior studies

> "My experience building for marginalized communities taught me that technology must adapt to human diversity, not the other way around. The same principle applies to AI."
> - On inclusive AI development

> "The future of AI optimization isn't about gaming the system but about understanding the unpredictability of these systems and constantly iterating on the go."
> - On strategic adaptation in AEO

## Professional Philosophy

Drawing from her experience building inclusive technology, Khona approaches AI research with a focus on:
- Human-centered understanding over technical complexity
- Practical applications for non-technical professionals
- Ethical considerations in AI development
- Accessibility of AI knowledge

## Current Projects

1. **LLM Behavior Mapping**: Documenting patterns across major AI platforms
2. **The Third Frontier**: Regular essays on AI-human interaction
