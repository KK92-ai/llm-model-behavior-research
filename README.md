# llm-model-behavior-research
Non-technical research on LLM model behavior patterns, AI-human interaction, and generative intelligence optimization (AEO) for marketing, product discovery and brand strategy. Exploring how LLMs interpret, respond, and discover content
# Kalyani Khona - LLM Model Behavior Research

## About My Research
I am a non-technical researcher studying how Large Language Models behave, interact, and discover information. My work bridges the gap between technical AI capabilities and practical applications in marketing, branding, and product strategy.

## Research Focus Areas

### 1. Model Behavior of LLMs
- Understanding pattern recognition in LLM responses
- Analyzing behavioral consistency across different prompts
- Developing non-technical frameworks for LLM decision-making
- Documenting response variations and model personalities

### 2. AI-Human Interaction & Philosophical Alignment
- Exploring trust dynamics in AI communication
- Studying alignment between brand voice and LLM outputs
- Investigating ethical considerations in marketing applications
- Analyzing how humans perceive and interact with AI responses

### 3. Generative Intelligence Optimization & AEO
- Developing brand strategies for AI discovery
- Creating frameworks for content optimization for LLM interpretation
- Pioneering AEO (AI Engine Optimization) methodologies
- Researching how LLMs discover and prioritize content

## Why This Matters
As LLMs become primary information interfaces, understanding their behavior from a non-technical perspective is crucial for:
- Marketers crafting AI-discoverable content
- Brands maintaining consistent voice across AI interactions
- Product strategists designing AI-first experiences
- Businesses optimizing for the AI-driven future

## Current Research Questions
- How do LLMs interpret brand messaging differently than humans?
- What patterns exist in LLM content discovery and prioritization?
- How can non-technical professionals effectively optimize for AI?
- What philosophical frameworks guide AI-human alignment?
