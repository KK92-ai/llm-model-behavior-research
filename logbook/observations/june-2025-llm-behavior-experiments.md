## August 8, 2025 (Friday)

Back on research after 2 week break
- Reviewing GEO case studies
- Audit framework for D2C brands (Atheleisure)

## July 23, 2025 (Wednesday)
- Query level research because multimodality or diverse content formats/types can be structured to trigger specific modality responses
- GTM meeting with Neusearch team

## July 22, 2025 (Tuesday)
- Gen AI - Multi Modal Research [Continued]

## July 21, 2025 (Monday)
- Gen AI - Multi Modal [Research Notes](https://github.com/KK92-ai/geo-advanced-research/blob/main/01-multimodal-search.md)

## July 16, 2025 (Wednesday)
- Completed NLP document and sent for feedback and review
- Neusearch technical discussion, meeting notes #2, GTM discussion notes in private repo. [private notes](https://github.com/KK92-ai/Neusearch/blob/main/meeting-notes-2.md)

## July 15, 2025 (Tuesday)
- [continue] NLP principles in LLM design & content optimization [working document](https://github.com/KK92-ai/llm-model-behavior-research/blob/main/research/nlp-principles-model-behavior-geo.md#2-how-models-process--rank-content)
- LLMs are good internet compilers, discovery tools since internet is huge but low on new insights, creativity and unique human like creativity. Gwern's [AI day dreaming](https://gwern.net/ai-daydreaming)
- Call with Neusearch team [notes](https://github.com/KK92-ai/Neusearch/blob/main/meeting%20notes-1.md)

## July 14, 2025 (Monday)
- Wikipedia sandbox experiment (3-4 weeks wait time for review, prep to test LLMs <> wikipedia citation improvements next month)
- o3 temperature experiment (same prompt, same time, both paid accounts, different IP got two different responses. Same context but structure, CTA i.e synthesis style were different.

## July 12, 2025 (Saturday)
- [Research notes](https://github.com/KK92-ai/llm-model-behavior-research/blob/main/research/image_generative_ai_research.md) for the meeting with the founder on image generative AI (computation costs, training data set and GTM)

## July 11, 2025 (Friday)
- [continue] NLP principles in LLM design & content optimization [working document](https://github.com/KK92-ai/llm-model-behavior-research/blob/main/research/nlp-principles-model-behavior-geo.md#2-how-models-process--rank-content)

## July 10, 2025 (Thursday)
- [Call with A from Akamai](https://github.com/KK92-ai/llm-model-behavior-research/blob/main/research/generative-search-ai-strategy-notes.md) to discuss investment updates, feedback on ongoing research, new trends in LLMs etc.
- The GEO space is ripe for disruption but there's a narrow window (6-12 months) before big tech platforms integrate these capabilities natively. Focus on actionable insights (and agentic execution) rather than just monitoring might provide more sustainable value.

## July 9, 2025 (Wednesday)

- [Research notes](https://github.com/KK92-ai/llm-model-behavior-research/blob/main/research/prompt-engineering-vs-fine-tuning-when-to-use-2025.md) on prompt engineering vs fine tuning, cost benefit analysis, model priority matrix
- Research notes and insights on GEO/AEO, LLM behaviour with [neusearch team](https://neusearch.ai/) - [private notes](https://github.com/KK92-ai/Neusearch/blob/main/meeting%20notes-1.md)
- ChatGPT x Bing for internet search (when ChatGPT crawls a website, the identifer could be bingbot and not chatgpt)

## July 8, 2025 (Tuesday)

- Understanding the basics of Llama base model and assistant model, parameters, pre-training data, fine tuning etc

## June 27, 2025 (Friday)
- Understanding the decision making workflow of a search query [How LLMs think](https://github.com/KK92-ai/llm-model-behavior-research/blob/main/research/how-llms-process-simple-vs-complex-queries-2025.md)

## June 26, 2025 (Thursday)
- Finalised the anatomical framework I will be using to compare results across LLMs.
- Started working on the [LLM taxonomy document](https://github.com/KK92-ai/llm-model-behavior-research/blob/main/research/llm-search-behavior-patterns-2025.md) for cross referencing.
- Started testing perplexity on "tell me everything about Kalyani Khona" through multiple formats - general query and deep research feature.

## Research Status
*This is a living document updated daily as part of my LLM behavior research.*

**Model Leaderboard**
[tracker](https://lmarena.ai/leaderboard)

**Research Focus**: Understanding LLM response patterns, generative engine optimization, answer engine optimization, NLP deep dive on content density, citation behaviors and landscape, and platform-specific content type/format preferences

## WIP

- Write taxonomy document [LLM taxonomy document](https://github.com/KK92-ai/llm-model-behavior-research/blob/main/research/llm-search-behavior-patterns-2025.md)
- Claude citation agent review [citation agent](https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-cookbook/blob/main/patterns/agents/prompts/citations_agent.md)
- Work on anatomical framework of LLM responses (experimentation with content type, citation hypothesis and density). [How LLMs think](https://github.com/KK92-ai/llm-model-behavior-research/blob/main/research/how-llms-process-simple-vs-complex-queries-2025.md)
